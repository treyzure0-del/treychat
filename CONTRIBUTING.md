# Contributing to EmpowerConnect (treychat)

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This document explains how to get involved and the project's basic workflow.

Code of conduct
- Be respectful and constructive. If you want a formal code of conduct, add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.

Branching & pull requests
- Default branch: main (or `trunk` if you prefer trunk-based development).
- Feature branches: feature/<short-description> (e.g., feature/auth-invite)
- Bugfix branches: fix/<short-description>
- Use small, focused PRs; include screenshots and tests where applicable.

Commit messages
- Use conventional commits style:
  - feat: add new feature
  - fix: bug fix
  - docs: documentation only changes
  - chore: maintenance tasks
- Keep messages concise and reference issue numbers when relevant.

PR checklist
- [ ] Branch up-to-date with main
- [ ] Tests added/updated
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] README or docs updated if relevant
- [ ] Description of changes and rationale provided

Coding conventions
- TypeScript for new code.
- Use ESLint + Prettier config (we can provide one).
- Keep components small and accessible; add unit tests.

Issues
- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Use templates (bug_report.md, feature_request.md) for clarity.

Local development
- Include steps to run the project locally in README or docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md.

Getting help
- If you're unsure where to start, look for issues labeled "good first issue" or ask a maintainer.

Thanks — contributions are appreciated!
